## Introduction

We live in a society where everything has to be done quickly. Impossible deadlines to meet, non-stop changing requirements, constant distractions... There are so many ways we can become lost in all of that.

But, a certain philosophy has started to come up recently. A philosophy that encourages us to slow down, re-focus on ourselves and on our values: the Slow Movement.

Popularized by Carl Honor√© with his book In Praise of Slow, the movement touched a lot of different ares of life. We have Slow Food, Slow Sex, Slow Cities... and of course, Slow Work.

Let's explore what it would mean for you to adopt the Slow Movement into your work day.

## Examine your work day rhythm

Before knowing what to change in your work life, you have to take the time to examine it. You need to assess your situation, and how it relates to your well-being. You can ask yourself some simple questions:

- Are you constantly under pressure?
- Do you feel like you are always in a rush?
- Can you identify circumstances to explain the situation? Is it something you can change? Does it involve a colleague, or a manager?

This is the first step of the process. You will most likely identify some very little things that you could change right away. Because sometimes, it's the little things that may create a non-stop sense of urgency.

## What does it mean for you to be productive?

## Take back your time
