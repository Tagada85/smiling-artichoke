      Hello everyone! My name is Damien Cosset and I am a French web developer.

      I have been a freelancer since 2016. I have used a bunch of technologies on my journey but I do have a preference for Javascript.

       I believe in empowering people and companies with technologies.

       On my blog, you will find different types of articles. Most of them will be Javascript related (React, React Native, Meteor, NodeJS...). I try to explain complicated terms in a beginner friendly way. Don't hesitate to ask questions in the comments if anything is unclear :)  I hope you will enjoy it!
