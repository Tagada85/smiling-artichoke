Hello everyone! My name is Damien Cosset and I am a French web developer.

Since late 2016, I work as a freelancer. I work mostly with Javascript technologies such as React or Meteor. I've also worked with Java for quite some time.

I believe in empowering people and companies with technologies. Code can make our lives better, but it can also make it worse if developers are not careful.

On my blog, you will find different types of articles, from classic tutorials to thoughts about our industry and freelancing. I hope you will enjoy it! :heart:
