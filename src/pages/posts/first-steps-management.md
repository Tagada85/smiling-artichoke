## New job, new me

It's been a while since a write something in here... Life gets in the way. I've been lucky enough to land a new gig, as a freelancer, and I have been tasked with managing a team.

It's been 3 months now that I took on a manager role, on top of the developer role and I thought it would be a good idea to write down this part of my journey. Not to teach, because I really don't know what I'm doing, but to record my experiences, organize my thoughts and perhaps learn from them.

## The context

Quick word about the context. I have never been, in my 7 years as a freelancer, part of a team of developers. I have always been the only developer. Being part of a team is really something I've come to enjoy. This feeling of belonging to a group, working towards the same goal, speaking the same developer language has been a breath of fresh air.

The company recruited some new people, and I'm now managing 2 other developers, who are juniors. I consider myself to be an intermediate level, but I love the idea of spreading the little knowledge and experience I have to help others.

## First steps

The first few weeks have been complicated. Obviously, when you don't know how to manage a team or a project, you have to make mistakes. I'm lucky to have a CTO that is always available to help, answer questions and provida guidance. In that regard, the environment is absolutely perfect.

There are, I believe, 3 things that went wrong for me at the beginning:

- Not using all the resources at my disposal
- Not understanding the bigger picture of the project
- Not trusting my coworkers enough

I'll touch on the first one here.

To manage efficiently, I must understand what resources I can use. Resources can take different forms, but for example:

- my team of developers
- the CTO willing to help me
- the company financial backing if I need tools
- the product owners knowledge
  ...

Because of my career being the story of a lonely developer doing everything by himself, I didn't realise that I should use all of this to achieve our goals. I tried to do too many things by myself, where other people had the knowledge to tell me what should be done, or how it should be done, or even better, **if** it should be done al all...

So, the first few weeks became a one man show. One manager trying to do everything, because he didn't understand that the manager's job is to correctly use the resources at his disposal. To be **efficient**. We ended up meeting goals for the first month, but it was a grind, that ended with a few 12 hours work days for me and my team.

So that was my first lesson. Understand that I have a whole bunch of different tools at my disposal, and that I can be creative in the way I use them to achieve the goals I've been set.

Many more to come.

See you soon <3
