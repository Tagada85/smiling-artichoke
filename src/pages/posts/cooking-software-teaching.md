Lately, I started to cook more fresh products in order to be more healthy and fight some minor food intolerance me and my girlfriend have. It became a nice little hobby! Here are some of the things I've learned from it when it comes to software engineering:

- I've learned nothing

Hobbies don't have to exist in the context of your job. They can just be, without having to be a way to improve your career or your network. We're more than our jobs. And I wish I realized that earlier.

Take care of yourselves :heart:
